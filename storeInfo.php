            <div class="panel">
                <p class="storestory">Homeport is a lifestyle and home furnishing store, offering a large range of products to suit your household needs. Located on Burlington's pedestrian-only Church Street, Homeport has four floors of everything you need for your home. The Bouchettâ€™s have been on Church Street for over 30 years and currently have three generations working in their store. Early in their career they traveled the world to find unique items to carry and have supported those relationships ever since. Each department manager handpicks items for the store thus adding to the diversity of the products. They also travel the country to various trade shows to meet with specialty vendors in order to carry items not commonly available. Homeport has found the perfect niche in being an import store and supporting local businesses throughout Vermont, the country, and all over the world. Most of the items that you see in the store can be found on their website, however there are many products that come into their doors every week that are one of a kind.<br><br>
