Using some sort of FTP transfer software like "Core ftp LE" which is available for free at:http://www.coreftp.com/ transfer the phpSchedule folder and all of its contents to the server directory where you would like it to be accessed from. 

For example if you want the schedules and dashboard to be accessed from :www.mydomain.com/phpSchedule then you would copy it to your server's root public directory as specified by your server host.

Once all of the files have been copied you can then begin to use the software. The login screen is the same for viewing schedules as it is for administrastion. the default logins are :to view schedules "1111" to administer the program "0000" you can, of course, change these using the [Change Logins] button. 

The program has been supplied with some default information in order to eliminate "empty file errors" you should begin by editing these items.

Before Creating Schedules you must First set up your employees, the departments you use, and the company info.

Now you can begin to add schedules. Once you have established a schedule you can save it as a default by selecting the check box to the right of the schedule line. 

***N.B. Schedules will NOT be created unless you enter a Start Of Week date in the three fields at the top of the screen. ***

So if you just want to save only the default information then just leave the Start Of Week fields blank. 

The other dashboard options should be fairly obvious remember to save your work befor exiting a screen [Return To Dashboard] and [Log Out] buttons exit WITHOUT saving.
