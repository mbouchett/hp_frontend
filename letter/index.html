To The Senators of Chittenden County,
 
	I am writing to you today to express a growing concern regarding safety and civility on our public streets in Burlington. 
	The issues of public intoxication, public urination and defecation, public sex acts, aggressive and harassing behavior, 
	commandeering and blocking public thoroughfares, sleeping and camping in both private and public spaces have always been with us. 
	Furthermore, community spaces like The Church Street Marketplace have always been especially attractive to people who demonstrate 
	these sorts of behaviors and incidence of these has risen to an intolerable level.

	The remedies available to the community for curbing these sorts of activities have been limited to misdemeanor citations and 
	nominal fines. This approach has always been ineffective and remains so. I have personally witnessed a citation ripped to pieces 
	and thrown in the air in the face of the officer who issued it. The fact is that these efforts are completely inconsequential to 
	the people engaged in these activities.
	
	I want to be clear that I am not concerned with a class of individuals here or any individual for that matter. What I am concerned 
	about is how people behave in shared and public places. I believe that my staff, which is composed largely of young women, have a 
	right to walk to and from their jobs in safety and unharassed. I don’t think that citizens and visitors to our town, who often come 
	with their children, ought be subject to aggressive behavior or witness to people’s private bodily functions. 

	To this end what I am asking for is a point at which a number of misdemeanor citations might be elevated to a criminal citation 
	that cannot be ignored in the way these lesser deterrents have been. 

	Thank you for considering this.
